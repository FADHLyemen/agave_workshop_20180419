This FREE workshop is sponsored by the University of Hawai'i Information Technology Service Cyberinfrastructure group, Texas Advanced Computing Center and Hawai'i EPSCoR.


This workshop focuses specifically on the introducing the Agave platform, Cyverse and R Agave tools that can enable compute, data management and analysis on distributed resources.

-- We will NOT be teaching R skills in this workshop, this interactive primer is about 2 hours (http://tryr.codeschool.com/)--

## Takeaways:

### By the end of this workshop students will be able to:
* Use Cyverse to launch computational jobs.
* Understand Docker and containers for reproducable science.
* Launch Docker containers on their laptops.
* Create applications using Agave.
* Launch computation on the UH HPC.


## Requirements before the Workshop:
* Participants should have a basic understanding of R - this interactive primer is about 2 hours (http://tryr.codeschool.com/)
* Participants should bring their laptops and plan to participate actively. Laptops will require a browser application for accessing Cyverse and the other online resources.  
* Docker will be required for running a special version of Rstudio for the workshop - you can download and install Docker community edition for your specific operating system here (https://store.docker.com/search?type=edition&offering=community)
